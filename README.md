## freeCodeCamp - Front-end Libraries Project - Random Quote Machine

I set out to create a random quote machine. The technologies I'll use are:
- CSS Flexbox
- Jest - because I want to practice how to automatically test my applications
- TDD - I will try to build using TDD mindset

I will write everything here using pure JavaScript, CSS and HTML. 
I won't rely on any additional framework other than ReactJS ecosystem.
